Visicut settings
================

Settings for [VisiCut](https://github.com/t-oster/VisiCut) (A userfriendly tool to prepare, save and send Jobs to Lasercutters) used by Fab Lab Region Nuernberg e.V.

Instructions
------------

In newer versions of VisiCut you can select 'Germany, Nuremberg: Fab Lab Region NÃ¼rnberg, e.V.' from
```Options -> Settings -> Download Recommended Settings ...```

In older versions of VisiCut you can use the ```Download ZIP``` link, and rename the .zip extension to .vcsettings and then use the Archive with ```Options -> Settings -> Import Settings ...``` If that does not work, you have to repack the archive, so that there is no toplevel directory.
